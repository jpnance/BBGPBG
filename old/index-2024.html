Using <a href="https://www.nfl.com/games/49ers-at-chiefs-2019-post-4">Super Bowl LIV</a> as an example, Kansas City's line score was "7 3 0 21 31" and San Francisco's was "3 7 10 0 20". Using the digits of the line score, you create the best five-card poker hand possible. In Kansas City's case, that would be two pair: "3 3 1 1 7"; in San Francisco's case, it's three-of-a-kind: "0 0 0 7 3". Three-of-a-kind being the best hand that either team had, this bet would have resolved to "Three-of-a-kind or worse" for Super Bowl LIV. 0s can be either high or low for straights but "9 0 1 2 3" is not a straight (no wrap-arounds)</dd></dl></fieldset><fieldset><legend>What will be the sum of the digits that comprise the final score?</legend><section><input type="radio" id="patrick-1-0" name="patrick-1" value="12 or more" data-proposer="Patrick" data-proposal="What will be the sum of the digits that comprise the final score?"><label for="patrick-1-0">12 or more</label><br><input type="radio" id="patrick-1-1" name="patrick-1" value="11 or less" data-proposer="Patrick" data-proposal="What will be the sum of the digits that comprise the final score?"><label for="patrick-1-1">11 or less</label><br><input type="radio" id="patrick-1-2" name="patrick-1" value="X" checked="checked" data-proposer="Patrick" data-proposal="What will be the sum of the digits that comprise the final score?"><label for="patrick-1-2">Decline to pick this prop</label></section><p>For example, a game ending 21-17 results in a sum-of-digits of 2 + 1 + 1 + 7 = 11.</p></fieldset><fieldset><legend>How many timeouts will go unused?</legend><section><input type="radio" id="patrick-2-0" name="patrick-2" value="4 or more" data-proposer="Patrick" data-proposal="How many timeouts will go unused?"><label for="patrick-2-0">4 or more</label><br><input type="radio" id="patrick-2-1" name="patrick-2" value="3 or fewer" data-proposer="Patrick" data-proposal="How many timeouts will go unused?"><label for="patrick-2-1">3 or fewer</label><br><input type="radio" id="patrick-2-2" name="patrick-2" value="X" checked="checked" data-proposer="Patrick" data-proposal="How many timeouts will go unused?"><label for="patrick-2-2">Decline to pick this prop</label></section></fieldset><fieldset><legend>Will the final play be a kneel-down?</legend><section><input type="radio" id="patrick-3-0" name="patrick-3" value="Yes" data-proposer="Patrick" data-proposal="Will the final play be a kneel-down?"><label for="patrick-3-0">Yes</label><br><input type="radio" id="patrick-3-1" name="patrick-3" value="No" data-proposer="Patrick" data-proposal="Will the final play be a kneel-down?"><label for="patrick-3-1">No</label><br><input type="radio" id="patrick-3-2" name="patrick-3" value="X" checked="checked" data-proposer="Patrick" data-proposal="Will the final play be a kneel-down?"><label for="patrick-3-2">Decline to pick this prop</label></section></fieldset><fieldset><legend>What will be the sum of the yardages of the longest rushing and receiving plays for each team (four plays total)?</legend><section><input type="radio" id="patrick-4-0" name="patrick-4" value="125 yards or more" data-proposer="Patrick" data-proposal="What will be the sum of the yardages of the longest rushing and receiving plays for each team (four plays total)?"><label for="patrick-4-0">125 yards or more</label><br><input type="radio" id="patrick-4-1" name="patrick-4" value="124 yards or less" data-proposer="Patrick" data-proposal="What will be the sum of the yardages of the longest rushing and receiving plays for each team (four plays total)?"><label for="patrick-4-1">124 yards or less</label><br><input type="radio" id="patrick-4-2" name="patrick-4" value="X" checked="checked" data-proposer="Patrick" data-proposal="What will be the sum of the yardages of the longest rushing and receiving plays for each team (four plays total)?"><label for="patrick-4-2">Decline to pick this prop</label></section></fieldset></details><details><summary>Reilly's Props</summary><fieldset><legend>Will either team's final score be a prime number or a Fibonacci number?</legend><section><input type="radio" id="reilly-0-0" name="reilly-0" value="Yes" data-proposer="Reilly" data-proposal="Will either team's final score be a prime number or a Fibonacci number?"><label for="reilly-0-0">Yes</label><br><input type="radio" id="reilly-0-1" name="reilly-0" value="No" data-proposer="Reilly" data-proposal="Will either team's final score be a prime number or a Fibonacci number?"><label for="reilly-0-1">No</label><br><input type="radio" id="reilly-0-2" name="reilly-0" value="X" checked="checked" data-proposer="Reilly" data-proposal="Will either team's final score be a prime number or a Fibonacci number?"><label for="reilly-0-2">Decline to pick this prop</label></section><dl><dt>prime number</dt><dd>A prime number is a positive integer x greater than 1 whose only positive integer factors are 1 and itself.
