Fibonacci number	For F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1, and F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2), a Fibonacci number is a non-negative integer x such that x = F(n) for some non-negative integer value of n. The first ten Fibonacci numbers in sequence are: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and 34.

line-score poker hand	At the end of the game, each team will have a line score comprised of the number of points they scored in the first quarter, then the second quarter, third quarter, fourth quarter, any overtime periods, and finally their final score. Using Super Bowl LIV as an example (https://www.nfl.com/games/49ers-at-chiefs-2019-post-4), Kansas City's line score was "7 3 0 21 31" and San Francisco's was "3 7 10 0 20". Using the digits of the line score, you create the best five-card poker hand possible. In Kansas City's case, that would be two pair: "3 3 1 1 7"; in San Francisco's case, it's three-of-a-kind: "0 0 0 7 3". Three-of-a-kind being the best hand that either team had, this bet would have resolved to "Three-of-a-kind or worse" for Super Bowl LIV. 0s can be either high or low for straights but "9 0 1 2 3" is not a straight (no wrap-arounds)
